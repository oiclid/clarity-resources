**# Clarity Resources**



Clarity is a new language that brings smart contracts to Bitcoin. It is a decidable language, meaning you can know, with certainty, from the code itself what the program will do. Clarity is interpreted (not compiled) & the source code is published on the blockchain. Clarity gives developers a safe way to build complex smart contracts. The Clarity open-source project is supported by the [Stacks ecosystem](https://blockstack.org/), [Hiro PBC](https://hiro.so/), & [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com/).



This repo is an aggregation of useful links, repos, tutorials, documentations, and anything useful I have found useful across the internet as I learn the language. If you think I may have omitted some great material, please make a PR and I'll accept it if I think it is relevant. You are also encouraged to fork it and do as you well.



May these be useful to you in your journey towards being a master Clarity programmer, and live long and prosper
